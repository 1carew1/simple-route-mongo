# Simple Route

This is a modification of a project called Simple Route which can be found here : https://github.com/1carew1/simple-route
The main difference is that the production build of the React app is used in this project and the Firebase Database has been swapped out for a Mongo DB backend which has a REST endpoint exposed via Express, all running through Node JS.

An extra feature was also added to show all the locations of where a user has accessed the site/specific searched locations.
